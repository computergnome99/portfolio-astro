# Portfolio Website (Astro Rebuild)

This is the repository for my 2025 Portfolio Website Rebuild using Astro. I
don't have a ton of experience with Astro outside of a few side-projects, so
building this site was a super fun learning experience.

I plan to add lots of new features to the site in the coming months (and
hopefully years), but I wanted to get something done and shipped quickly for an
initial website.

Feel free to look around at any of the code and open an issue or start a
discussion if you see anything that could use improvement or if you have a
question about something.
