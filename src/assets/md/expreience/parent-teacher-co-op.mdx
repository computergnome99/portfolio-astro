In 2021, I began teaching the "Home and Office Computing" class for high school
students at the Parent Teacher Co-Op. Thanks to some positive reviews and good
word-of-mouth, the class quickly became quite popular. Later, in 2024, I started
teaching an additional class, originally called "Intro to Computer Programming"
but later renamed to "Computer Science and Proramming", which focuses more on
programming concepts and computer science, rather than general computing skills.
Both classes emphasize practical skills and encourage critical thinking.

## Planning and Materials Preperation

For both classes, I design a custom syllabus, not directly leveraging any
pre-existing textbooks or resources to ensure that the material is practical,
engaging, up-to-date, and relevant for the age group. Each year, I revise the
syllabus based on student and parent feedback and incorporate changes in the
tech landscape to keep the content relevant.

Prepared materials include the year's syllabus, class constitution (standard PTC
agreement between students, teachers, and parents), worksheets, exams, quizzes,
and more, all created specifically for the class.

Additionally, a significant focus of the class is on Biblical study and
application. Every class meeting is preceded by a short devotional, which I also
prepare before the start of the school year.

## Lecturing and Class Management

In the classroom, I employ a dynamic teaching style that includes lectures,
hands-on projects, and interactive discussions to engage students effectively. I
strive to maintain a structured yet flexible learning environment that
accommodates various learning styles. Classroom management is a key focus,
ensuring that lessons proceed smoothly and that all students remain focused and
respectful of the learning process.

## Grading and Extracurricular Communication

Outside of class hours, I am responsible for grading assignments, quizzes, and
exams, ensuring timely feedback that is constructive and encourages student
improvement. I also maintain regular communication with students and parents to
discuss academic progress and any concerns that arise. This includes scheduling
meetings, responding to emails, and providing additional resources to support
student learning.
