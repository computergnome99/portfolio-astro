In the summer of 2021, I was hired at Crowe LLP to maintain their product design
system and cultivate a user-focused front-end development practice. During my
tenure, my role evolved to include the responsibilities of a lead developer,
spearheading the design system project. I built over a dozen new components and
refactored numerous existing ones, ensuring the system's robustness and
enhancing both developer and end-user experiences. Collaborating closely with
UI/UX designers, as well as a few fellow developers, we successfully overhauled
the design system, delivering a product we were genuinely proud of.

## Development and Engineering

A significant portion of my role was dedicated to developing the product design
system. Built in Angular, the design system included a component library, CSS
framework, graphics library, and themes for supported third-party libraries like
Angular Material.

Regarding development, my responsibilities encompassed building and maintaining
all parts of the system, implementing new features, managing releases, and
patching bugs. Additionally, I collaborated with product teams to assist with
the implementation and integration of the system into their applications.

The component library featured over 50 different components and templates, each
refined and frequently refactored to ensure an optimal developer experience,
consistent design patterns, and accessible end-user interfaces. We also
implemented a pipeline for exporting web components in addition to Angular
components, enabling cross-framework and platform-based consumption of
components.

The design system also included an in-depth documentation repository, built as a
standalone Angular application. This application pulled in static markdown files
and combined them with live examples from a Storybook JS instance to create
compelling and helpful technical documentation. Much of my time working on this
application was spent creating new features, including the Storybook JS
instance, and finding ways to automate the creation and publication of
documentation, reducing discrepancies between deployed features and their
documentation.

## Strategy and Architecture

As I transitioned into a lead role with the design system, I was tasked with
more strategic decision-making, including creating a roadmap of features,
setting project priorities based on developer and end-user feedback, and
scheduling regular touchpoints with product teams to gather insights. I
documented these decisions and their outcomes in roadmaps, changelogs, and
release notes.

Additionally, I researched, determined, and documented standards for project
contributions, Git usage, automated PR code-quality checks, post-PR CI/CD
pipelines, and overall code quality. Some of these standards were gradually
integrated into linter configurations for both Prettier and ESLint, which were
published as NPM packages and distributed to application development teams.

## Education and Thought Leadership

Another notable part of my role at Crowe involved the education of application
teams and developers regarding the use of Angular and front-end development best
practices. I hosted several training events for teams and worked one-on-one with
developers to both train and help implement features into their applications.
