After leaving Crowe, two friends and I set out to address what we saw as a
widespread challenge in product development: siloed teams. Too often, designers,
developers, and product managers work in isolation, leading to misaligned goals
and poor collaboration. Our solution was to create The Connected Product - a
bi-weekly newsletter exploring how product teams can become more collaborative,
communicative, and purpose-driven.

Each issue focuses on a shared topic, with perspectives from a Designer, a
Product Manager, and myself as a Developer. Topics have ranged from time
management and QA to documentation and team culture, with the long-term goal of
compiling these insights into focused learning materials.

Beyond writing, I built and maintain the technical platform behind the
newsletter. This includes the public site (built with HTMX and Astro), a
back-end integration with Beehiiv's API to sync published newsletters, and the
overall infrastructure that supports distribution and growth.

Our focus has been on consistency and quality rather than short-term engagement.
Over time, we aim to build a knowledge base that both product teams and
individuals can learn from - and eventually extend that into practical resources
like e-books.
