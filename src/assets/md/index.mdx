# intro

Hello, my name is **Calvin Bonner**.

I'm a developer, husband & father, Neovim enjoyer, Arch user (btw), teacher,
Christian, and part-time reformed theology enthusiast.

I enjoy building products for users, tools for developers, and constantly
pushing myself to learn new things. I've spent the better part of the last
decade working in the web technologies space, but my broader experience includes
everything from Epicor ERP systems to Visual Basic apps in Excel. Lately I've
also picked up writing, and
[started a product-focused newsletter with some
friends in the industry](/experience/the-connected-product-llc).

During the school year, I
[teach high school Computer Science at a homeschool
co-op](/experience/parent-teacher-co-op). My teaching is hands-on and
project-based, with a strong focus on ministry and equipping Christ-followers to
use technology responsibly.

In my free time, I enjoy building an ever-growing list of side projects,
spending time with my wife and daughters, fixing my truck, and reading sermons,
biblical commentaries, and learning more about my Savior and King.
