During my\ntenure, my role evolved to include the responsibilities of a lead developer,\nspearheading the design system project. I built over a dozen new components and\nrefactored numerous existing ones, ensuring the system's robustness and\nenhancing both developer and end-user experiences. Collaborating closely with\nUI/UX designers, as well as a few fellow developers, we successfully overhauled\nthe design system, delivering a product we were genuinely proud of.\n\n## Development and Engineering\n\nA significant portion of my role was dedicated to developing the product design\nsystem. Built in Angular, the design system included a component library, CSS\nframework, graphics library, and themes for supported third-party libraries like\nAngular Material.\n\nRegarding development, my responsibilities encompassed building and maintaining\nall parts of the system, implementing new features, managing releases, and\npatching bugs. Additionally, I collaborated with product teams to assist with\nthe implementation and integration of the system into their applications.\n\nThe component library featured over 50 different components and templates, each\nrefined and frequently refactored to ensure an optimal developer experience,\nconsistent design patterns, and accessible end-user interfaces. We also\nimplemented a pipeline for exporting web components in addition to Angular\ncomponents, enabling cross-framework and platform-based consumption of\ncomponents.\n\nThe design system also included an in-depth documentation repository, built as a\nstandalone Angular application. This application pulled in static markdown files\nand combined them with live examples from a Storybook JS instance to create\ncompelling and helpful technical documentation. Much of my time working on this\napplication was spent creating new features, including the Storybook JS\ninstance, and finding ways to automate the creation and publication of\ndocumentation, reducing discrepancies between deployed features and their\ndocumentation.\n\n## Strategy and Architecture\n\nAs I transitioned into a lead role with the design system, I was tasked with\nmore strategic decision-making, including creating a roadmap of features,\nsetting project priorities based on developer and end-user feedback, and\nscheduling regular touchpoints with product teams to gather insights. I\ndocumented these decisions and their outcomes in roadmaps, changelogs, and\nrelease notes.\n\nAdditionally, I researched, determined, and documented standards for project\ncontributions, Git usage, automated PR code-quality checks, post-PR CI/CD\npipelines, and overall code quality. Some of these standards were gradually\nintegrated into linter configurations for both Prettier and ESLint, which were\npublished as NPM packages and distributed to application development teams.\n\n## Education and Thought Leadership\n\nAnother notable part of my role at Crowe involved the education of application\nteams and developers regarding the use of Angular and front-end development best\npractices. I hosted several training events for teams and worked one-on-one with\ndevelopers to both train and help implement features into their applications.","src/assets/md/expreience/crowe-llp.mdx","70fe194476d5f78f","parent-teacher-co-op",{id:29,data:31,body:35,filePath:36,digest:37,deferredRender:19},{title:32,date:33,role:34},"Parent Teacher Co-op","2021 - Present","Computer Teacher","import { Ascii } from '@components/ascii';\n\n<Ascii name=\"ptc\" color=\"lavender\" spaced />\n\nIn 2021, I began teaching the \"Home and Office Computing\" class for high school\nstudents at the Parent Teacher Co-Op. Thanks to some positive reviews and good\nword-of-mouth, the class quickly became quite popular. Later, in 2024, I started\nteaching an additional class, originally called \"Intro to Computer Programming\"\nbut later renamed to \"Computer Science and Proramming\", which focuses more on\nprogramming concepts and computer science, rather than general computing skills.\nBoth classes emphasize practical skills and encourage critical thinking.\n\n## Planning and Materials Preperation\n\nFor both classes, I design a custom syllabus, not directly leveraging any\npre-existing textbooks or resources to ensure that the material is practical,\nengaging, up-to-date, and relevant for the age group. Each year, I revise the\nsyllabus based on student and parent feedback and incorporate changes in the\ntech landscape to keep the content relevant.\n\nPrepared materials include the year's syllabus, class constitution (standard PTC\nagreement between students, teachers, and parents), worksheets, exams, quizzes,\nand more, all created specifically for the class.\n\nAdditionally, a significant focus of the class is on Biblical study and\napplication. Every class meeting is preceded by a short devotional, which I also\nprepare before the start of the school year.\n\n## Lecturing and Class Management\n\nIn the classroom, I employ a dynamic teaching style that includes lectures,\nhands-on projects, and interactive discussions to engage students effectively. I\nstrive to maintain a structured yet flexible learning environment that\naccommodates various learning styles. Classroom management is a key focus,\nensuring that lessons proceed smoothly and that all students remain focused and\nrespectful of the learning process.\n\n## Grading and Extracurricular Communication\n\nOutside of class hours, I am responsible for grading assignments, quizzes, and\nexams, ensuring timely feedback that is constructive and encourages student\nimprovement. I also maintain regular communication with students and parents to\ndiscuss academic progress and any concerns that arise. This includes scheduling\nmeetings, responding to emails, and providing additional resources to support\nstudent learning.","src/assets/md/expreience/parent-teacher-co-op.mdx","691896c3a85472e8","personal-contracting",{id:38,data:40,body:43,filePath:44,digest:45,deferredRender:19},{title:41,date:42},"Personal Contracting","2008 - Present","Since 2008, I have worked as a private contractor or sub-contractor in the IT,\nWeb/Software Development, and Database Management spaces, gaining extensive\nexperience across various domains.
